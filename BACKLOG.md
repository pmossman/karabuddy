# karabuddy backlog

Source of truth for outstanding work. The autonomous loop pulls from **Backlog** (top-down = highest priority), moves the claimed entry into **In Progress** while working, and appends it to **Done** when complete.

## Conventions

- Every task has a stable ID like `B1`, `B2`, etc. IDs are append-only — never reuse one even after deletion.
- The next new task uses the highest existing ID + 1 across all sections (Backlog + In Progress + Done).
- A task is **claimed** by moving its block under `## In Progress` and adding a `_claimed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM by <agent>_` line at the top of the block. Only one task should sit in In Progress per agent at a time.
- A task is **finished** by moving its block to the top of `## Done` and adding a `_completed: YYYY-MM-DD by <agent>_` line. Include a one-line summary of what shipped.
- Tasks should always have **Acceptance** so "done" is unambiguous.
- Screenshots / references / prior conversation links go under **Refs**.

## Backlog

### [B11] Game log highlight follows "what's new since last step", not current frame only

- **Why:** B2 ported the per-frame log but highlights only entries whose `frameIndex === currentIndex`. Actions can span multiple frames, so when the user steps from frame 5 → frame 12 (action mode skipping intervening gamestates), only frame 12's messages light up and everything in between goes fully dim. The extension behaves differently — it tracks the last transition and highlights every frame's messages that fall in the `(from, to]` range. This is what users actually want: "what just happened" since they pressed the arrow.
- **Acceptance:**
  - Forward step (current=lo, target=hi where hi > lo): messages on frames `lo+1 .. hi` render at full opacity; everything earlier dimmed.
  - Backward step (target < lo) OR initial load: messages on the current frame only render at full opacity; everything else dimmed. (Matches extension behavior — "stepping back doesn't re-narrate; just show what's there.")
  - Header copy adapts: forward over multiple frames → "What happened (over N frames)"; single-frame forward or backward → "What happened at this frame" (current copy).
  - Tracking the "last transition" needs new state. Recommend `lastTransition: {from: number, to: number} | null` in `ReplayViewer`'s state, set whenever `setCurrentIndex` is called. Pass `lastTransition` to `TagSidebar` alongside `currentIndex`.
- **Refs:** Extension reference: `~/code/karabuddy/extension/replays/05-footer.js` — search `lastTransition` and `logFrames` for the exact logic. Karabuddy files: `app/(app)/r/[slug]/ReplayViewer.tsx` (introduces `lastTransition` state + wires it on every step) and `app/(app)/r/[slug]/TagSidebar.tsx` (consumes it in the FrameLog section to compute the highlight set).

### [B10] Compact the viewer sidebar — give the log + tags more vertical room
_completed: 2026-05-26 by autonomous-loop_
Inline single-row matchup (32×32 thumbs + usernames). Share controls collapsed behind a top-right Share icon button + popover. Step-mode toggle (Action/Frame + Shift hint) tucked into a gear popover next to the frame counter. Navigation tightened to a single `← [Frame N/M] → [gear]` row. New reusable `app/_components/Popover.tsx`. Net ~170–180px reclaimed above the fold.

### [B9] Monorepo: chrome extension brought into karabuddy
_completed: 2026-05-26 by autonomous-loop_
`git subtree add --squash` from `~/code/karabast-extension` + working-tree overlay (the source repo had 18 uncommitted modifications) → `extension/` subdir at repo root (22 files). `.vercelignore` added (excludes `extension/` from deploy bundle). `tsconfig.json` excludes `extension/` defensively. `CLAUDE.md` updated with load-unpacked + zip-packaging workflow. `~/code/karabast-extension/` left untouched for the user to archive.

### [B1] Game board bottom is clipped under the persistent header
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
Subtracted `var(--kb-header-h)` from the Gameboard root `height` in `app/_components/Gameboard/Gameboard.tsx` and switched the inner row heights from `dvh` to percentages so the tray rows sum against the constrained container.

### [B2] Restore the per-frame "what happened" log in the sidebar
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
Plumbed `messagesByFrame` from ReplayViewer → TagSidebar; added a new FrameLog section between the tag-form and All-tags sections. Current-frame messages at full opacity, prior frames dimmed to ~0.45. Ported the extension's player color-coding (frame-0 players 0/1 → blue/red).

### [B3] When at a tag's frame, don't duplicate it in the All Tags list
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
"All tags" list now filters out tags whose `frameIndex === currentIndex`; the THIS FRAME callout stays as the sole renderer for those. Empty-state copy when only current-frame tags exist.

### [B4] Opponent hand card backs render as solid black
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
Root cause: `stripHiddenHandCards` assigned hidden hand stubs `setId.set = 'REPLAYHIDDEN'`, which made `s3CardImageURL` build a 404 URL instead of taking the no-setId cardback fallback. Added an early-return in `app/_utils/s3Utils.ts` so any card with the `HIDDEN_SET` sentinel renders as the cardback art.

### [B5] Strip non-functional interactive UI from the replay viewer
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
Removed the X (close), gear (settings), and chat-expand controls + their handlers/props from `OpponentCardTray`, `PlayerCardTray`, `GameboardTypes`, and `Gameboard.tsx`. Sidebar slot is hardcoded open so the right-padding stays for the viewer's tag sidebar.

### [B6] Share affordance in the viewer (copy link + public toggle)
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
New Share section above Navigation. "Copy link" for everyone with `navigator.clipboard` + `execCommand` fallback (label flips to "Copied!" for ~2s). Owner-only visibility pill with optimistic toggle (revert on server failure). Owner check mirrors the server's `canMutate` (session userId OR install token).

### [B7] Refine tag ownership: replay owner can delete, only author can edit
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
Server: split `canMutate` → `canEdit` (tag author only, PATCH) + `canDelete` (tag author OR replay owner, DELETE). Client TagSidebar computes `canEdit` / `canDelete` per tag from the session + install token + replay ownership. Replay owners see Delete on others' tags but no Edit; tag authors keep both.

### [B8] Hint keyboard navigation on the prev/next frame arrow buttons
_completed: 2026-05-26 by subagent_
`title=` tooltips on ← / → buttons ("Previous frame (←)" / "Next frame (→)"). One-line italic hint "Or use arrow keys to step." under the prev/next tag buttons. Existing Shift-modifier hint untouched.
